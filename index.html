        <p>
          I am a software developer who loves understanding, staring at, and solving probelms. I have an undying curisoisty for any issue complecx enough to make me stare at it for a while. Understanding the how to solve a problem, but also why it happened and how to prevern it is how I work best.

            This app a dating app which shows you your astorological compatibility with potential matches. You are able to see your profile, swipe through other profiles, and start chats with your matches. We decided apon a dating app as we thought it would be a different experience to design a mobile app. We decided apon a starry theme to match the main idea of the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team and I built this app using a a Ruby backend  and a Javascript frontend. For the backend we used Rails, and for the front end we used React and Redux. We used Auth0 for Authentication. We decided apon a dating app as we thought it would be a different experience to design a mobile app.

            This app is a a way for me to keep track of my favorite recipies. It will allows the user to click on a recipe and veiw its ingredients and how to make it. Features I am still working on are the ability to click on an ingredient and see all the recipies it is included in, and the ability to select multiple recipies and the app will make you a shoppinglist.

            I originally buluit this app with a Javascript backend using Node.js, SQLite and Knex, and a Javascript frontend with Handlebars. Later on during my course I learned React and Redux, so I convirted my app from handlebars to those newer technologies to practice them.

            This app is a random fact generator. You are able to generate new facts, and save your favorite ones. I wanted it to be bright and exciting to match the content of the app.

            I built this app originally as an introduction to integrating external and internal APIs into a single project. Using a simple fact generating API, I built the frontend of this site with Javascript using React and Redux. I built the backend using SQLite3, Knex and Node.js.

            This app shows and shames all the cancelled buses from metlink in the past week. As a group we felt we always were late due to public transport, so we made an app to reall see what the extent of the pulic trasportation crisis was.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team and I built this app using the metlink API, we also had a simple backend with taglines for our banner and for comments. The backend was built with Node.js, Knex and SQLite. The frontend was built with React.
