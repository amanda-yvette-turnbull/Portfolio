        <p>
          I am a software developer who loves understanding, staring at, and solving problems. I have an undying curiosity for any issue complex enough to make me stare at it for a while. Understanding the how to solve a problem, but also why it happened and how to prevent it is how I work best.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently graduated from Dev Academy, a 15-week full-stack web development bootcamp. Some of my skills include:

            This app a dating app which shows you your astrological compatibility with potential matches. You are able to see your profile, swipe through other profiles, and start chats with your matches. We decided on a dating app as we thought it would be a different experience to design a mobile app. We decided on a starry theme to match the main idea of the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team and I built this app using a a Ruby backend  and a Javascript frontend. For the backend we used Rails, and for the front end we used React and Redux. We used Auth0 for Authentication. We decided apon a dating app as we thought it would be a different experience to design a mobile app.

            This app is a a way for me to keep track of my favorite recipes. It will allows the user to click on a recipe and view its ingredients and how to make it. Features I am still working on are the ability to click on an ingredient and see all the recipes it is included in, and the ability to select multiple recipes and the app will make you a shopping list. 
          </p>

            I originally built this app with a Javascript backend using Node.js, SQLite and Knex, and a Javascript frontend with Handlebars. Later on during my course I learned React and Redux, so I converted my app from handlebars to those newer technologies to practice them.

            This app is a random fact generator. You are able to generate new facts, and save your favorite ones. I wanted it to be bright and exciting to match the content of the app.

            I built this app originally as an introduction to integrating external and internal APIs into a single project. Using a simple fact generating API, I built the frontend of this site with Javascript using React and Redux. I built the backend using SQLite3, Knex and Node.js.
